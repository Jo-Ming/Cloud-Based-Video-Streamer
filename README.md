# video_player_app

A couple of years ago, I wanted to make a drip feed video streaming application using Firebase. After making most of it, I took a break for a few months and Thinkific released their mobile app. 
So here is a functioning video-streaming template for a Flutter application that can stream videos saved in Firestore.
